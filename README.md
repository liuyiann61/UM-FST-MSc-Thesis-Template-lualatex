# UM-FST-MSc-Thesis-LaTeX-TMPL-utf-8
This is a LaTeX template for a master's thesis, which follows the requirements of the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) of the University of Macao.
This template adds a .latexmkrc file. It can use latexmk compiler to automatically complete the template.
This template uses luatex/xetex, biblatex, and glossaries. 
Therefore, the traditional compile sequence is luatex/xetex->biber->Makeglossaries->luatex/xetex. In the TeXStudio editor, the compile sequence is:luatex/xetex->Makeglossaries->luatex/xetex
## Welcome to pull requests to further improve the template.
